Lab Exercise #9 -- SPARC Control Constructs

1. Complete the following table to show the contents of the l ("local")
registers after the program executes.  Give the contents of each register as a
decimal number and as a hexadecimal number.  If the program does not place a
value into a given local register, write "unknown" as your answer.

         Decimal Value             Hexadecimal Value

   %l0:  __________45__________    __0000002d____________

   %l1:  __________76__________    __0000004c____________

   %l2:  ___________1__________    __00000001____________

   %l3:  __________78__________    __0000004e____________

   %l4:  _________135__________    __00000087____________

   %l5:  ___________4__________    __00000004____________

   %l6:  ___________2__________    __00000002____________

   %l7:  ___________7__________    __00000007____________


2. The output produced by the program is shown below.  Circle and label the
memory area corresponding to the four integer variables ("W", "X", etc).

   MEMORY CONTENTS [00021a64 to 00021a93]
     00021a64: 
     00021a74:             00 00 00 37 00 00 00 48 00 00 00 34
     00021a84: 00 00 00 4e 

3. Based on the output produced by the program, complete the following table
to show the address and contents of each of the four integer variables.  Give
your answers as eight-digit hexadecimal numbers (including leading zeroes).

       address of variable       contents of variable

   W:  __00021a78____________    __00000037____________

   X:  __00021a7c____________    __00000048____________

   Y:  __00021a80____________    __00000034____________

   Z:  __00021a84____________    __0000004e____________
