Lab Exercise #7 -- Floating Point Representation

A. The file named "lab07.viewdp" contains an executable program which allows
the user to enter any real constant and displays the corresponding 64-bit
internal representation of that constant.

1. Use "lab07.viewdp" to complete the following table.

   Real constant    Internal representation (in hexadecimal)
   -------------    ----------------------------------------

   1.0              3ff0000000000000

   2.0              4000000000000000

   4.0              4010000000000000

   4.5              4012000000000000

   4.25             4011000000000000

   4.125            4010800000000000


2. Use "lab07.viewdp" to complete the following table.

   Real constant    Internal representation (in hexadecimal)
   -------------    ----------------------------------------

   3.14             40091eb851eb851f

   3.142            400922d0e5604189

   3.1416           400921ff2e48e8a7

   3.14159265359    400921fb54442eea

   bonus:           400921fb54442d18  (value of M_PI from the math library)


3. What is the internal representation (in hexadecimal) of 0.0 (zero)?

  0000000000000000


4. What is the internal representation (in hexadecimal) of 1.0e+500 (a value
which is too large to represent)?

  7ff0000000000000 (Infinity)


5. The largest real number which can be represented is a value between
1.0e+308 and 2.0e+308.  Use the program to find the largest 4-digit decimal
number (in the form X.XXXe+308) which can be represented.

  1.797e+308 ==> 7feffcd7672f2096
  1.798E+308 ==> 7ff0000000000000 (Infinity)


B. The file named "lab07.makedp" contains an executable program which allows
the user to enter the internal representation of a 64-bit floating point
number and displays the corresponding real constant.

1. Use "lab07.makedp" to complete the following table.

   Internal representation    Real constant
   -----------------------    -------------

   4069 0000 0000 0000        200.0

   4069 0400 0000 0000        200.125

   4520 8B2A 2C28 0291        1.0e+25

   39B4 484B FEEB C2A0        1.0e-30


2. Use "lab07.makedp" to complete the following table.

   Internal representation    Real constant
   -----------------------    -------------

   400A 6666 6666 6664        3.299999999999999

   400A 6666 6666 6665        3.299999999999999

   400A 6666 6666 6666        3.3

   400A 6666 6666 6667        3.3


3. What is the decimal value of the largest and most precise real constant
that can be represented as a double-precision floating point number?

  7fefffffffffffff ==> 1.797693134862316e+308


4. What is the decimal value of the smallest positive real constant that can
be represented as a normalized double-precision floating point number?

  0010000000000000 ==> 2.225073858507201e-308


5. A "denormal" floating point number is one in which the biased exponent is
zero, but the fraction field is non-zero.  The smallest denormal floating
point number which can be represented in 64 bits is 0000 0000 0000 0001.  What
is the value of this number as a decimal real constant?

  0000000000000001 ==> 4.940656458412465e-324


C. Write a C program which demonstrates overflow, underflow, and loss of
precision on floating point numbers.  Use type "float" and type "double" in
the program.
